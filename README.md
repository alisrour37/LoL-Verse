# LoL-Verse
League of Legends community project using ReactJS, Laravel, Firebase, ElasticSearch, and Redux.

In the browser open localhost:3000/ only because it defaults to localhost:3000/black-dashboard-react which won't open anything.

You also have to use php artisan serve with a terminal open in the backend folder on localhost:8000

Don't forget to install all the required dependencies with npm install on both the Frontend and Backend folder. You might also have to install passport for Laravel for authentication purposes.

Enjoy!
